# job-autofiller

## Load Chrome extension
```
1. chrome://extensions/
2. Developer mode on
3. Load unpacked
```

## How to use
Edit the values on `data.json` and add new entries when necessary. The `sites.json` file contains the hostnames that are supported by this extension and the values that can be autofilled. The input value in `sites.json` is mapped to the value provided in `data.json`.

When you are on either `https://boards.greenhouse.io/*` or `https://jobs.lever.co/*`, it will automatically trigger the script and edit the dom content.
